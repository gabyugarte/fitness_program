Problem Statement
Health professionals who are helping a client achieve a healthy body weight, sometimes use two computed measures named body mass index and basal metabolic rate.

From the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we read, "Body mass index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. BMI can be used to screen for weight categories such as underweight, normal, overweight, and obese that may lead to health problems. However, BMI is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual." The formula for computing BMI is

bmi = 
10,000 weight
height2
where weight is in kilograms and height is in centimeters.

Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum number of calories required daily to keep your body functioning at rest. BMR is different for women and men and changes with age. The revised Harris-Benedict formulas for computing BMR are

(women)  bmr = 447.593 + 9.247 weight + 3.098 height − 4.330 age
(men)  bmr = 88.362 + 13.397 weight + 4.799 height − 5.677 age
where weight is in kilograms and height is in centimeters.
